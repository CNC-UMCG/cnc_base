Currently, I am working on a managed pipeline system with the following specifications:
- Source system: [XNAT 1.7](https://www.xnat.org)
- Python listener, which transports XNAT DICOM data to HPC
- Catalogue of Singularity images with software (see below)
- The required image / pipeline is configured in XNAT as additional resource / input
- Pipeline output is stored on [iRODS](https://irods.org)
- Logfiles will be stored in electronic elabjournal via REST ([BIO-itech](https://www.bio-itech.nl/en/products/eln/))

## Planned catalogue ##

| Name | Description |
--- | --- 
| **cnc_base** | ubuntu 16.04 image with dcm2niix and datalab. <br>Additionally, our conversion script using dcm2niix with additional organization of files |
